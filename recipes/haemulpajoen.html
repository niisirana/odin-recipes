        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dipping sauce by mixing the sauce ingredients in a small bowl.
                Prepare the seafood by thawing in cold water if frozen. Drain excess water and season with salt and pepper. 
                Cut scallions length and crosswise (see image for reference) and slice the red chili pepper if using.
                </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, add equal parts of Korean pancake mix and tempura mix. 
                Add in ice-cold water and mix well. The batter should be thin and runny. 
                Add in the prepared seafood and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Heat 3-4 tablespoons of oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat. 
                Ladle 1/2 of the mixture onto the pan and spread it evenly using the ladle. 
                Arrange half of the sliced red chili pepper on top (optional).</li>
            <li>Use a large spatula to lift the edge of the pancake, and flip promptly when the bottom is golden brown. 
                Add a bit more oil around the edges if preferred, and cook until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes. 
                Repeat the process for the second pancake.</li>
            <li>Cut into bite-sized pieces and serve warm with the dipping sauce!
